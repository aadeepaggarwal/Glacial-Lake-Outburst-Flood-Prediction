<h1>üåä AI-Powered Glacial Lake Flood Forecasting</h1>
<h3>Project by Aadeep Aggarwal</h3>

<hr>

<h2>üìÑ Project Summary</h2>
<p>
    This project focuses on building an AI-driven early warning system to predict <strong>Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs)</strong> 
    using environmental data, machine learning, and real-time monitoring. Motivated by the growing impact of climate change 
    and the devastating floods seen in recent years, this system aims to provide timely, actionable insights to help 
    communities and authorities prevent large-scale damage and loss of life.
</p>

<h2>üö® The Challenge</h2>
<p>
    As global temperatures rise, glaciers are melting rapidly, causing the formation and expansion of glacial lakes. 
    These lakes often sit behind natural dams that can suddenly burst, releasing massive volumes of water downstream. 
    Traditional monitoring methods are reactive and offer limited predictive capability, leaving little time for evacuation 
    or mitigation. This project leverages AI for proactive detection and early forecasting of GLOF events.
</p>

<h2>üéØ Project Objectives</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Build a Predictive AI Model:</strong> Develop machine learning models using environmental data such as temperature, precipitation, satellite imagery, and lake water levels to forecast GLOF risks.</li>
    <li><strong>Real-Time Data Integration:</strong> Establish a continuous monitoring pipeline that ingests live data from satellites, sensors, and weather stations to update predictions.</li>
    <li><strong>Early Warning System:</strong> Implement an automated alert system to notify authorities and at-risk communities through SMS, emails, or mobile notifications.</li>
</ul>

<h2>‚ú® Key Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Environmental Data Pipeline:</strong> Real-time integration from MODIS, Landsat, and local hydrological and meteorological sources.</li>
    <li><strong>AI-Powered Prediction:</strong> Machine learning models for early detection of glacial lake instability using time series forecasting and anomaly detection techniques.</li>
    <li><strong>Automated Alerts:</strong> Instant notifications sent via SMS (Twilio) and email (SendGrid) upon detection of high-risk events.</li>
    <li><strong>Scalable & Modular:</strong> System designed to be deployed easily in various glacial regions globally.</li>
</ul>

<h2>üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Programming:</strong> Python</li>
    <li><strong>Machine Learning:</strong> Scikit-learn, TensorFlow</li>
    <li><strong>Data Processing:</strong> Pandas, NumPy</li>
    <li><strong>Modeling Techniques:</strong> Time Series Analysis, Regression, Anomaly Detection</li>
    <li><strong>Deployment:</strong> Flask (API), Docker (Containerization)</li>
    <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> Twilio (SMS), SendGrid (Email)</li>
</ul>

<h2>üìä Data Sources</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Satellite Data:</strong> MODIS, Landsat imagery for monitoring glacial lakes</li>
    <li><strong>Climate Data:</strong> Weather station data including temperature, precipitation, and other indicators</li>
    <li><strong>Hydrological Data:</strong> Lake water levels, river discharge, historical flood records</li>
</ul>

<h2>üåç Why This Project Matters</h2>
<p>
    With the increasing frequency and severity of glacial lake floods due to climate change, AI offers a 
    proactive approach to disaster risk reduction. This project empowers communities with crucial lead time 
    to act, helping save lives and protect infrastructure by providing reliable early warnings.
