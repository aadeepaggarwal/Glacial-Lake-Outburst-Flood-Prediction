# Glacial-Lake-Outburst-Flood-Prediction
Designed an early warning system using AI/ML for GLOF risk prediction, integrating seismic, rainfall, wind, water temperature, and lake color sensors for real-time environmental monitoring. Implemented TensorFlow, PyTorch, XGBoost, and Isolation Forest models for anomaly detection, fine-tuning with real-time data.
